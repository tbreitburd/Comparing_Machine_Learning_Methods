# Coursework

This repository is for the submission of your coursework for the M1 Applied Data Science module. 

You have been given access with the role of "Maintainer" for this repository which will expire on the 20th of December at 23:59, which is the submission deadline for this work. Please check in good time that you have appropriate access permissions to your project and that the access expires at the appropriate time

You should commit **both** your code **and** your report to this repository.

## The problem

The coursework assignment and associated data files have been released on the course [Moodle page](https://www.vle.cam.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=252189#section-3) and also in the course [Gitlab project](https://gitlab.developers.cam.ac.uk/phy/data-intensive-science-mphil/m1_applied_data_science).

## Criteria

The goal of this coursework project is for you to demonstrate that you can use some of the techniques (data preprocessing, supervised learning, unsupervised learning) we have discussed in the course.

You will need to demonstrate the following:

 - You can write clear, readable and well-documented code that is simple to run
 - You can justify the approach you have taken and interpret the results

You will be assessed on:

 - The clarity and ease with which your code can be read and run
 - The scientific justifcation in your report write-up
 - How informative and well-explained your plots are
 - The writing quality and style including the spelling and grammar

Your code should be written in Python. You may use any libraries that have been discussed during the course (in particular `scikit-learn`). It should be simple to run and be runnable from the command line. You should prioritise writing clear code over fast code. You may create separate scripts for different questions, provided these are clearly identifiable. 

The project should contain a `README.md` file which describes **exactly** how to run the code. You should provide a Conda environment (e.g. an `environment.yml` file).
Please include your `README.md` file as an Appendix of your report (that will not count towards the word limit) and provide some details of how long it took you to run your code and the specifications of the machine you ran it on.

Please remember the relevant section of the handbook that refers to use of ChatGPT etc. in your academic work, specifically the following passage:

"Generation tools must be used transparently:

All use of auto-generation tools must be explicitly cited in every instance of their use.
This applies to generating code, whether used for prototyping, creation, reformatting, or any other purpose. Students should add the citations to the README in home repository, and in any accompanying reports stating the prompts submitted, where the output was used, and how it was modified.
When used in conjunction with submitted reports for drafting, proofreading, suggesting alternative wordings, or for any other task it should be explicitly noted in an appendix to the report with the prompts submitted, where the output was used, and how it was modified.
Failure to adequately cite use of these tools is considered academic misconduct. "

## Submission

You should write a report of **no more than 3000 words**. The report should be written in LaTeX. Your report should contain two sections, labelled "Section A" and "Section B". You should aim to be concise, while fully answering each question. You should not try to answer a question using more approaches than is indicated. It is more important that you explain and justify your approach than it is to get the answer "right".

Both your code **and** your report should be submitted in this repository. 
The generated PDF of your report should be placed in the `report` subdirectory.
The `README.md` file should contain short and simple instructions on how to run your code. Please **make sure** your code is portable and reproducible within the Conda environment.  I will not be able to spend much time and effort attempting to debug your code if it does not run as described.
